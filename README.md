# Iris_Flower_classfication

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petalmeasurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.
